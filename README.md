This is Jérôme Plumier's GitHub repository for STAT545's MDA R project. 

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore, visualise, and analyse various datasets contained in the `datateachr` package. For this project, I chose to investigate the `vancouver_trees` dataset.

The objectives of this project are divided in two parts:
1. [Milestone 1](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/): (Due **Friday. October 6, 2023 at 17:00 PT**)
  - Explore `datateachr` datasets.
  - Choose a dataset to investigate.
  - Formulate four research questions for the chosen dataset.
  - Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.

2. [Milestone 2](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-2/): (Due **Wednesday, October 25, 2023 at 17:00 PT**)
  - Understand what tidy data is, and how to create it using tidyr.
  - Manipulate special data types in R: factors and/or dates and times.
  - Fit a model object to a chosen data, and extract a result.
  - Read and write data as separate files.
  - Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown.

## Content Description
A folder will be created for each milestone.
- The Milestone 1 Folder contains the files needed for the Milestone 1 submission.

## Interacting with the repository
**To run code:** Clone the repository and open the chosen `.Rmd` file using JupyterLab or RStudio. The files can then be run. 

**View code:** Select the chosen folder and open the `.md` file of interest. The file can then be viewed in your browser.
